// The SDK against a real dashboard, end to end.
//
// Every other test in this repo proves one half on its own: the archive has the
// right entries, the session SQL is right, the redactor strips what it was told
// to. None of them prove the two halves still agree, because both sides assert
// against a shape that is written down twice — once here and once in Go. Two
// copies of a contract drift, and nothing fails when they do.
//
// This test writes it down nowhere. It logs through the public API, lets the
// worker compress and upload, and reads the rows back out of the dashboard. If
// a field is renamed on either side, this is what goes red.
//
// Skipped unless CS_E2E_BASE points at a running server, the same way the Go
// integration tests skip without CS_TEST_DB. `make test-sdk-e2e` in the
// code_scout repo starts a throwaway server and database and sets it.
